    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this banana
      bread recipe on hand. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list:
      <li><b>Flour</b>: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Baking soda</b>: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps
        the banana bread rise.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Salt</b>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't
        make the loaf taste salty.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Butter</b>: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and
        irresistible flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Brown sugar</b>: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of
        warmth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eggs</b>: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the
        batter together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Bananas</b>: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>

        bananas.
      </li>
      <li>Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture.</li>
      <li>Pour the batter into a loaf pan and bake in a preheated oven.</li>
